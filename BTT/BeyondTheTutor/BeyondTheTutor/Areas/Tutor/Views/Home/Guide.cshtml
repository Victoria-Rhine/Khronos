                        new { @class = (ViewBag.Current == "StuResIndex" ? "item red active" : "item") }) are an easy way to
                        share helpful and interesting finds with your students. In the @Html.ActionLink("Add New", "Create",
"StudentResources", new { area = "" }, htmlAttributes: new
{
@class = (ViewBag.Current == "StuResCreate" ?
"item red active" : "item")
}) form you will enter a topic for your resource. Example topics are "Java",
                        "Semantic UI", "CSS Styling". Make the topic simple and searchable. You will provide the website URL for
                        your resource by copying and pasting it into the appropropriate box. And you will decide how you want the
                        link displayed. Example displays are "Parse Trees - Wikipedia", "AJAX - CS 461", "HTML Tutorial". Make
                        displays simple and searchable.

                        This allows you to chat with students in real-time.<br />

                    <p>
                        If you don't have a Discord account we recommend signing up <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        Join the tutoring server by clicking DISCORD LOGIN in the chat box. <b>You may join the server with a pre-existing Discord account</b>.<br />

                    <p>
                        Real-time chat is intended for quick help. If a student's needs require significant time then politely recommend
                        they visit the tutoring center or schedule a tutoring session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Real-time chat is intended for use while you are scheduled in the tutoring center. If you would like to work with a student
                        outside your normal tutoring hours please recommend they schedule a tutoring session so that you are compensated for your time.
